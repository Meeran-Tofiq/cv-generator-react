# CV Generator

This web page is a cv generator application, made using the React framework. It allows you to create CV forms, by inputting the data you want to appear on the CV.

## Motivation

This project was made as an assingment for The Odin Project, specifically for the React section. It was intended to give me practice with using React's components and the State Hook provided by react.
